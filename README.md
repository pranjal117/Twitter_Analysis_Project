# Twitter_Analysis_Project

A project to analyze the sentiment of a particular person and their followers on twitter and
monitor its change and impact on the views of the general audience with time. It uses
twitter API and calculates the average “hedonometer” score for twitter handles and
generates a time series data of the sentiment.
